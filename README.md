## Recent Projects
While the majority of my work cannot be shared due to it being proprietary to the companies I've worked for, I try to upload projects that I can make public here. Please see the links and descriptions below.

> <b>[Property Data Analysis](https://github.com/JamesBuntwal/PropertyDataAnalysis)</b>
>
> This was a piece of analysis I undertook as part of an application to a Senior Data Scientist role. I received excellent feedback.
> 
> <b>[Managing Datetime Partitions](https://github.com/JamesBuntwal/ManageDT)</b>
>
> This is a small class I created whilst working at Crimtan. We used hourly partitions within the hive database so I created this class to more conveniently manage the use of these partitions. It contains useful type conversions and various methods for iteration. It significantly reduced the bulkiness of my data manipulation code.
