> <b>[Property Data Analysis](https://github.com/JamesBuntwal/ManageDT)</b>
>
> This is a small class I created whilst working at Crimtan. We used hourly partitions within the hive database so I created this class to more conveniently manage the use of these partitions. It contains useful type conversions and various methods for iteration. It significantly reduced the bulkiness of my data manipulation code.
